# Perform a manual compromise of SWA credentials

Okta SWA acts a secure password manager that stores credentials at the Okta tenant instead of in the
browser and allows the Okta administrator to manage the credentials instead of the user.
A browser extension notices landing on a configured application, requests the credentials
from the Okta tenant, and provides them to the application.
This often leads to an expectation of privacy on the part of the Okta administrator, a belief
that the credentials cannot are secure through to the application.

The following are manual steps a user can follow to intercept the login and capture the credentials using Chrome or Edge. Firefox and Safari require a browser extension to be installed to
automatically launch the developer tools, so while these
instructions could be adapted they will not be discussed here.
Of course the Okta Browser Plugin must be installed in whichever browser is used.

Familiarity is required with running commands in the Terminal or
PowerShell, browser developer tools, following network calls in developer tools,
HTML forms, and JavaScript. 

### Configure Chrome or Microsoft Edge

Ensure the Okta plugin is installed in the browser and linked to the organization that
has the SWA application configured.
Test the application from the Okta dashboard to make sure it launches correctly.

In order to investigate the application Okta launches, the developer tools must automatically
open in the browser window for the application.
This requires launching Chrome or Edge with the option turned on before invoking the
application from Okta.
The option will not work if any copies of the browser are already running when used.

#### Using Microsoft Windows

1. Close all visible copies of Chrome or Edge.

1. When Microsoft Edge is launched by clicking the application icon it
continues to run in the background after the window is closed.
Open the task manager, search for "edge", and end any running tasks:

    ![Background Task](./.assets/edge-background-task.png)

1. From Windows Powershell launch Chrome or Edge with the option to start developer tools
with one of the following commands:
    ```
    PS > start chrome --auto-open-devtools-for-tabs
    PS > start msedge --auto-open-devtools-for-tabs
    ```

1. In the developer tools panel open settings (the gear in Chrome or the menu in Edge).
In the section for the Network enable "Preserve Log", "Record Network Log",
and "Network request blocking":

    ![Devtools Settings](./.assets/devtoos-settings-network.png)

#### Using Apple MacOS

1. Close all visible copies of Chrome or Edge.

1. When Microsoft Edge is launched by clicking the application icon it
continues to run in the background after the window is closed.
Open a Terminal window and terminate any Edge processes:
    ```
    $ pkill "Microsoft Edge"
    ```

1. From a Terminal window launch Chrome or Edge with one of the following commands:
    ```
    $ open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app" --args --auto-open-devtools-for-tabs
    $ open -a "/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app" --args --auto-open-devtools-for-tabs
    ```

1. In the developer tools panel open settings (the gear in Chrome or the menu in Edge).
In the section for the Network enable "Preserve Log", "Record Network Log",
and "Network request blocking":

### Isolate the login page

In the browser window just opened, sign on to the Okta dashboard, locate the SWA
application, and launch it.
The application will open in a new tab, but the developer tools will open while it is
launching and the network requests will be logged.

The login page should be the first page loaded in a new browser tab after any Okta stuff
when the user chooses the tile on their dashboard:

![Application Request](./.assets/okta-application-landing-page.png)

Click on the page to open the details and check the "Request URL" to get the full path:

![Application Request URL](./.assets/okta-application-landing-page-details.png)

In another tab load that page.
Ignore any request from the Okta plugin to sign in to the sight; the point here
is to examine the HTML elements on this page.
Right click on the button that submits the login and "inspect" the elements:

![Application Form](./.assets/swa-application-inspect.png)

While looking at the form, identify the input fields used for the username and
password and make a note of the "id" attribute values.
They will be used in a future step:

![Application Fields](./.assets/swa-application-field-ids.png)

#### Scenario A - Pure HTML

If the button is merely an HTML submit button, then the form tag is of interest
to identify the URL where the form is submitted.
If there is no action defined, and no JavaScript is invoked, then the submission URL
is the same page at the server.

If a simple submission got back to the network history in the tab that the application
sucessfully loaded in, find the request to that URL, right click the request, and block
the URL:

![Application URL block](./.assets/swa-application-block-url.png)

Skip "Scenario B" and proceed with the next step.

#### Scenario B - JavaScript

If the sign on button launches JavaScript for the authentication, then the JavaScript
needs to be blocked.

In this example the form executes a function "validate".
The fastest way to find that function is to switch to the console and ask the
JavaScript REPL to identify the function.
Only use the name in the request, no parantheses.
The REPL will return the definition of the function:

![REPL Definition](./.assets/repl-function-definition.png)

Click on the definition and the browser will open the function code.
In the code, click to the left of the first line in the function and
set a breakpoint (this is an example function):

![DevTools Breakpoint](./.assets/devtools-breakpoint.png)

### Capture the credentials!

Go back to the Okta dashboard and launch the application again.
This time it will pause, either blocked on the URL load or at the
breakpoint in the debugger:

![DevTools Paused](./.assets/devtools-paused.png)

In the developer tools panel switch to the console.
Use the document.getElementById() method to query the value
for the two fields identified previously with their ids:

![DevTools Credentials](./.assets/devtools-credentials.png)

Even though an HTML password field is not exposed on the screen,
the value is still in memory and accessible via JavaScript!
